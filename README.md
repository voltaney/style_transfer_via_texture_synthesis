# Paper Implementation
The main parts of the following two papers, "Style Transfer" and "Texture Synthesis".
The purpose of this repository is just to see what results can be obtained from the methods in the papers.

- V. Kwatra, I. Essa, A. Bobick and N. Kwatra, "Texture optimization for example-based synthesis", ACM Trans. Graph., vol. 24, no. 3, pp. 795-802, 2005.
- M. Elad and P. Milanfar, "Style Transfer Via Texture Synthesis," in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 2338-2351, May 2017.

## Texture optimization for example-based synthesis
| Input sample | Output |
----| ---- 
|![input_sample](test_images/texture_synthesis/input_sample/wara.jpg "input_sample") | ![output](test_images/texture_synthesis/output/wara.jpg "output")|

### How to use
See or run `test_texture_synthesis.py`.

### Not implemented method (propsed in the paper)
- Call-off function applied to the patch during the EM algorithm in the paper.
- Flow-guided synthesis

## Style Transfer Via Texture Synthesis

### How to use
See or run `test_style_transfer.py`.

### Not implemented method (propsed in the paper)
- Any segmentation
    - Instead, using edge detection to calculate the weights and fuse contents.
- Denoise by domain-transform
- ANN using PCA
    - Instead, "NN using hierarchical clustering" and "ANN using FAISS" are implemented.
